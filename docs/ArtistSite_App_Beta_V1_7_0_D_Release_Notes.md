## WHAT'S NEW

### Mobile Navigation
Hamburger menu replaces the horizontal nav bar on screens ≤768px wide. Tap the three-line icon to reveal a slide-down menu with all navigation links. NEATO and APPS sections show their sub-items indented below the parent. Menu closes automatically when you navigate to a page.

### Mobile Card Layout
Image cards now display text across the full card width on mobile, with a dark overlay over the background image for readability. Text is brightened and includes a subtle shadow for contrast.

### Mobile Marquee
The news ticker at the bottom of the home page scrolls horizontally on mobile instead of fading between items. Fits the full message on screen as it scrolls across.

### Banner Panels Hidden on Mobile
The draggable image panel and YouTube player panel on the home page are hidden on mobile since they require WebGPU and desktop interaction patterns.

### Support Link
The "Donate" / Buy Me a Coffee card on the Shop page has been replaced with a "Support" card linking to the YouTube channel. Drop a Super Thanks, subscribe, or just come hang out.
